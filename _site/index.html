  <p>College opportunity can be measured in any number of ways. One common
measure of opportunity is the spatial availability of postsecondary
institutions. Simply stated: for a given area—let’s say a
county—how many colleges are nearby? Even easier: does this county
have a college? Much academic research and policy work uses these
count and indicator measures when trying to account for college
opportunity.</p>

  <p>Yet these measures are not without their flaws. Indicator
metrics treat counties with one college the same as those with 10, 20,
30, or more and hide much of the variation across the country. While
count measures return this variation, they assume that the student
college decision is bounded by the county. These boundaries ignore
migration/commuter zones and the fact that the county may not have
salience for most students. Is the school in state? That may matter to
a student; is the school in the same county—not so much.</p>

  <p>Another measure, the inverse log distance to surrounding schools,
attempts to improve upon these other measures. Using the
population-weighted centroid of each county, the straight-line (“as
the crow flies distance”) is measured to each college in the
country. Taking the log of these numbers and summing their inverses, a
measure is constructed for each county. Higher numbers mean a higher
density of schools; lower numbers mean fewer schools.</p>

  <p>The map above visualizes each of these measures for various samples
of colleges and universities. For the indicators, a county is shaded
if there are any schools within the sample in the county. Hovering
over the county with give the number of schools. Sliding the toggle
switch gives the distance measures. These too are computed for a
variety of school samples under one of two conditions. Either all
relevant schools are included in the measure or only those within the
same state.</p>
