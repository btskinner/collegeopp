  <p>College opportunity can be measured in any number of ways. One common
measure of opportunity is the spatial availability of postsecondary
institutions. Simply stated: for a given area—let’s say a
county—how many colleges are nearby? Even more simply: does this county
have a college? Much academic research and policy work uses these
count and indicator measures when trying to account for college
opportunity.</p>

  <p>Yet these measures are not without their flaws. Indicator metrics
treat counties with one college the same as those with 10, 20, 30, or
more, effectively saying that being near one college is the same as
being near many. While count measures take the number of colleges into
account, they assume that the student college decision is bounded by
the county. These boundaries ignore migration/commuter zones and the
fact that county boundaries may not be salient for most students.</p>

  <p>Another measure, the inverse log distance to surrounding schools,
represents an attempt to more accurately measure college availability
in an area. Using the population-weighted centroid of each county<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>,
the straight-line (“as the crow flies” distance) is measured to each
college in the country<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Taking the natural log of these
numbers and summing their inverses<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, a measure is constructed for
each county. Higher numbers mean a higher density of schools; lower
numbers mean fewer schools.</p>

  <p>The map above visualizes each of these measures for various samples
of colleges and universities. For the indicators, a county is shaded
if there are any schools within the sample in the county. Hovering
over the county will give the number of schools. Sliding the toggle
switch gives the distance measures. These too are computed for a
variety of school samples under one of two conditions. Either all
relevant schools are included in the measure or only those within the
same state.</p>

  <h3 id="indicators">Indicators</h3>

  <p>A little over 40% of all counties have at least one postsecondary
institution<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> within their borders. Here are the percentages for
each category:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Any school: 43.9%</li>
    <li>Public 4-year: 14.9%</li>
    <li>Public 2-year: 23.1%</li>
    <li>Private 4-year: 11.1%</li>
    <li>Private 2-year: 2.8%</li>
    <li>Proprietary 4-year: 4.1%</li>
    <li>Proprietary 2-year: 7.1%</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="distance">Distance</h3>

  <p>The two cuts of distance measure—all sampled schools vs. only those
within the same state as the county—produce two distinct types of
map. Because inverse log distance measures aren’t particularly
intuitive, deciles of the z-scores are mapped. Counties with values
below the 50th percentile are red; those above the 50th are blue. Hues
for both colors become darker as the values move away from the
middle. In the distribution of all counties, those shaded dark red have
the lowest density of schools whereas those shaded dark blue are at
the top.</p>

  <h5 id="move-to-ohio-maps">“Move to Ohio” maps</h5>

  <p>For the measures that include out-of-state schools, a number of
“move to Ohio” maps are produced. While upon first glance it may seem
that the Old Northwest states have the highest density of colleges in
the country, these maps really measure the nationally-weighted
center. The large number of colleges in New England pull the college
density center away from the lower-48 geographic center.</p>

  <p>These maps are most interesting when visualizing how different
sub-samples of schools move this center. While the sub-sample of only
public 4-year institutions pulls the center toward the New England
states, the sub-sample of public 2-years shifts it further south and
west, reflecting state systems found in those regions.</p>

  <h5 id="state-patchwork-maps">State patchwork maps</h5>

  <p>When only considering in-state schools for each county’s measure,
patchwork maps are produced. Some states, such as California, Florida,
and North Carolina, remain in the upper deciles of college density
no matter the sub-sample. Other states, like Massachusetts, Tennessee,
and Washington, move in the distribution depending on the type of
schools considered.</p>

  <p>Because the differences in college density between states is often
greater than the differences within, many states have a uniform shade
in these maps. A few states, however, do show variation within their
borders. In some cases, like Georgia with in-state 2-year colleges,
these are around city centers. In others, like in-state public 2-year
colleges in Kentucky, differences occur in counties that contain that
type of institution.</p>

      <p>The distribution of college distances for each county is right skewed. By taking the natural log of these values, the distribution becomes more normal and the influence of extreme values is reduced. Summing the inverse of the values, rather than their level, produces a final measure that is positively (rather than negatively) correlated with the number of nearby schools. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
